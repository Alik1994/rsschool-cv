## About myself:

The first time I met programming languages at a summer camp, when I was about 15 years old. My first programming language was Pascal. It was really interesting and exciting for me. Unfortunately, I did not have a good teacher in my school for keep my new hobby. Thats why I forgot about programming languages for long years.

Three years ago I decided to continue studying programming languages as a my new hobby. I started by learning HTML and CSS to create my own web-sites. It was I little bit hard, because I am a chemist. But I really liked doing it after my main job.

After two years, I started to create beautiful web-sites and then I understood, that I want to work as a front-end developer. But my knowledge was not enough for that. And I resolved to learn Java Script to improve my skills.

Today I can create web-sites and know the basics of JS. I believe that with my responsibility and great desire, I will become a front-end developer.
